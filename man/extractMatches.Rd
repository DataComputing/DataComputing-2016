\title{Extract substrings that match a regex}
\usage{
extractMatches(data, pattern, var, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame. Or, use a pipe to specify the data frame.}

\item{pattern}{the regex to be used for matching}

\item{var}{the name of the variable from which to extract the substrings}
}
\value{
a data frame that copies the original but adds a new variable
giving the substring identified in the first parentheses.  If there
are more than one set of extraction parentheses, a new variable is added for each.
}
\description{
Pulls out the matches for marked regions of regular expressions.
}
\details{
Wrap regexes in parentheses to signal that the matching content
is to be extracted as a string.

Use parentheses to mark out parts of regular expressions
that identify substrings to be extracted if there is a match.
For instance, the pattern \code{"(.*)[aeiouy]$"} matches all strings ending in a vowel.
The \code{"(.*)"} indicates that the substring to be extracted is all the characters in
the string up to that final vowel. NA is returned for strings that have no match.
}
\examples{
# grab the root of names ending in vowels.
mosaicData::KidsFeet \%>\% extractMatches(pattern="(.*)[aeiouy]$", name)
# Two matches:
# grab the first letter (if capitalized) in strings ending in a vowel
# also grab any letter between the third character and the final vowel.
mosaicData::KidsFeet \%>\% extractMatches(pattern="^([A-Z])..(.*)[aeiouy]$", name)
}
